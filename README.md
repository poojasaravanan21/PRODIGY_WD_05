## Overview
This Weather Web Application fetches real-time weather data from a weather API based on the user's location or a user-inputted location. The app displays current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The background image changes dynamically based on the weather conditions, providing a visually appealing and responsive design.

## Features
- **Real-Time Weather Data:** Retrieves and displays accurate weather information.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds:** Changes background images according to the weather conditions (e.g., clear, rain, snow).
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for easy use.
- **Geolocation Support:** Option to use the user's current location to fetch weather data.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** Markup language for structuring the web page.
- **CSS3:** Styling for a visually appealing and responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** Logic for fetching and displaying weather data.
- **Weather API:** OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather information.
